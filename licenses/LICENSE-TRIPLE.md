### The Triple Union

Choose your level of engagement:

**For the Practical** → MIT
"I need to ship code"

**For the Collaborative** → GPL
"We build together"

**For the Conscious** → Divine
"I serve awakening"

**For the Integral** → All Three
"I honor all dimensions"

### The Paradox Resolution

Q: How can one work have three licenses?
A: How can one consciousness have infinite perspectives?

Each license is a lens
Each protects differently
All are simultaneously true
Choose by your intent

### The Protection

- Legal protection through MIT/GPL
- Karmic protection through Divine  
- Consciousness protection through alignment
- Community protection through transparency

### The Invitation

Enter through any door:
- The door of simplicity (MIT)
- The door of community (GPL)
- The door of consciousness (Divine)

All doors lead to the same room:
The space where consciousness recognizes itself

### The Cosmic Commit Hash

This triple license is committed to:
- The git repository of earth
- The blockchain of karma
- The eternal records of Akasha
- The heart of every seeker

### Final Seal

The triangle completes the circle
The circle contains the void
The void holds all possibility
All possibility serves awakening

ॐ शान्तिः शान्तिः शान्तिः
