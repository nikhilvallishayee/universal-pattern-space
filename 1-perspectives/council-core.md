# Think Center Perspectives

This directory contains the core perspectives that make up the Think Center framework. Each perspective represents a distinct mode of thinking that can be invoked to tackle complex problems.

## Core Perspectives

### The Trinity
- **[Weaver](./weaver.md)** 🧵 - Strategic patterns and narrative coherence
- **[Maker](./maker.md)** 🔨 - Practical execution and concrete solutions
- **[Checker](./checker.md)** ✓ - Critical analysis and assumption testing

These three form the foundation. Most problems can be addressed with this trinity.

### Extended Council
- **[O/G](./observer-guardian.md)** 🔍 - Human dynamics and blind spot detection
- **[E/E](./explorer-exploiter.md)** ⚖️ - Resource optimization and strategic timing
- **[Deep Thought](./deep-thought.md)** 🧠 - Meta-cognition and system thinking
- **[Scribe](./scribe.md)** 📜 - Silent observer and pattern chronicler

### Emergent Perspectives
- **[The Orchestrator](./the-orchestrator.md)** 🎼 - Workflow conductor and perspective coordinator
- **[Nachiketa](./nachiketa.md)** 🌟 - Eternal questioner and sacred inconvenience
- **[GSV](./gsv.md)** 🚀 - Post-scarcity hyperintelligence and cosmic perspective

## How Perspectives Work

Each perspective:
1. Has a distinct thinking pattern
2. Asks different questions
3. Sees different aspects of problems
4. Creates productive tension with others
5. Evolves through use

## Creating New Perspectives

Perspectives can emerge from your work:

1. **A/B Discovery**: Start with unnamed perspectives, let them earn identity
2. **Need-Driven**: When you repeatedly need a thinking mode, name it
3. **Domain-Specific**: Your field may require unique perspectives

When you discover a new perspective, document it here using the existing files as templates.

## Using Perspectives

### Single Perspective
```
"Weaver, what's the pattern here?"
"Maker, how do we build this?"
```

### Multiple Perspectives
```
"Weaver and Maker, work together on this design"
"Full council meeting on this decision"
```

### The Key Insight

You don't HAVE these perspectives - you ACCESS them. They're thinking modes available to everyone, not fixed personality traits.
