## Morning Protocol (15-20 minutes)

### 1. Mindset Priming (Hill)
**Duration**: 5 minutes

Ask:
- Does my top priority fit my hedgehog concept?

- Is this aligned with my identity ("I am the type of person who...")?

**Why**: Clarity of focus before action prevents wasted effort.

### 3. Strategic Awareness (48 Laws)

Consider:

## The Protocol Mindset

These aren't rigid rules—they're **thinking frameworks**. The goal isn't perfect execution but conscious application. Miss a day? Don't guilt-trip—learn why and adjust.

**Remember**:
- Power Consciousness is practice, not theory
- Integration takes time—be patient
- Reality provides feedback—listen
- Compound effects require consistency
- Excellence is daily, not eventual

*"The gap between knowing and doing is the gap between failure and success."*

Knowledge from these books means nothing without application. These protocols bridge the gap. Not perfectly—but consistently.

Start with morning protocol. Add evening. Then weekly. Let the practice teach you.

Power Consciousness isn't read—it's practiced.
