```

### Step 3: Custom Application Priorities

Add your specific priorities after the main navigation guide:

```markdown
## My Custom Priorities

### Always Apply in My Work
- [Specific protocol 1 most relevant to your domain]
- [Specific protocol 2 most relevant to your domain]
- [Specific protocol 3 most relevant to your domain]

### My Go-To Combinations
- For [common situation 1]: Use [perspective combo]
- For [common situation 2]: Use [perspective combo]
- For [common situation 3]: Use [perspective combo]

### My Reality Testing Methods
- [How you validate in your domain]
- [What "working" means in your context]
- [Your success metrics]
```

### Step 4: Integration Examples

#### Engineering Integration
```markdown
## My Integration Approach
- **Morning standup**: Weaver perspective for pattern recognition
- **Debugging sessions**: Collision protocol between Architect/Implementer/Tester
- **Architecture reviews**: Full council engagement
- **Code reviews**: Checker + Observer/Guardian for quality and user impact
```

#### Leadership Integration
```markdown
## My Integration Approach
- **Strategic planning**: Full council with compression dynamics
- **Team meetings**: Observer/Guardian awareness + Explorer/Exploiter resource optimization
- **Decision making**: Resistance protocol + reality testing
- **Innovation sessions**: Collision protocol for breakthrough
```

## ðŸŒŸ Advanced Customization

### Creating Domain-Specific Protocols

```markdown
## My Custom Protocol: [Name]
**When to use**: [Specific situation in your domain]
**Perspectives involved**: [Which ones and why]
**Process**:
1. [Step adapted to your context]
2. [Step adapted to your context]
3. [Step adapted to your context]
**Expected outcome**: [What success looks like in your domain]
```

### Language Adaptation Examples

#### From Generic to Domain-Specific:
- **Generic**: "Apply collision protocol for breakthrough"
- **Engineering**: "Run parallel debugging with system/user/business perspectives"
- **Business**: "Facilitate strategic collision between market/operations/finance views"
- **Creative**: "Let inspiration/craft/audience collide for breakthrough"
- **Wellness**: "Allow symptom/system/solution perspectives to inform each other"

## ðŸŽ¯ Remember

**The key to successful customization**:
1. Keep the core navigation guide intact
2. Add your context, don't replace
3. Translate perspectives to your domain
4. Test with real situations
5. Evolve based on what works

**The framework adapts to you, not you to the framework!**
